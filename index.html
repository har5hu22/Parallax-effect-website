             <p><ul>Adventure sports are a set of activities that are perceived to involve a high degree of risk
                and excitement. These activities often involve speed, height, a high level of physical exertion, and
                highly specialized gear or spectacular stunts . Here are some examples of adventure sports:

                <li>Air-based activities: Skydiving, paragliding, hang gliding, and parasailing.</li>
                <li>Water-based activities: Canoeing, kayaking, rafting, and scuba diving.</li>
                <li>Ocean-related activities: Deep-sea diving, sailing, and windsurfing.</li>
                <li>Snow-based activities: Skiing, snowboarding, and ice climbing.</li>
                <li>Land-based activities: Bungee jumping, dirt biking, zorbing, mountain biking, and rock climbing.
                </li>
                <li>Extreme activities: Volcano boarding, cave diving, wingsuit flying, running of the bulls, and the
                    cage
                    of death.</li>

            </div>
            <p class="text">Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually
                using specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but
                incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, such as air or
                coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials, and
                mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes. Mountain biking can generally be broken down into
                five distinct categories: cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as "Enduro"),
                downhill, and freeride.</p>

                <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders:
                lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot
                sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by
                the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
                forces of the air flowing over the outside.

                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of
                kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm.
                By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a
                few thousand metres.</p>

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text error">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem
                surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually
                carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores,
                but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal
                bore, or in wave pools.<br>
                <br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are
                several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
                the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on
                their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a
                wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
